              <p>This was created for a practical, the goal was to create a depth first search algorithm to find solutions for late-binding-solitare and an alternative saving grace version. This required a lot of recursive and interesting thinking. Also the testing of our algorithm in it's correctness and also efficiency was extremely important so a strong understanding and research was necessary to pass these tests.</p>

              <p>I had a report along with this practical that had extensive evaluation of my algorithm in it's effectiveness and limits of what it could achieve. It required even more understanding which was a fantastic experience, refining and seeing where possible inefficiencies lay.</p>
